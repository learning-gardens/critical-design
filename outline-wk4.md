Critical Design 2016: Reading Outlines

Week 4: Environment

Wijetunga, Dinuka 2014 The Digital Divide Objectified in the Design: Use of the Mobile Telephone by Underprivileged Youth in Sri Lanka. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication 19(3): 712–726.

However, there is evidence that the monumental growth in mobile penetration of the poor populace is not paralleled by a growth in the quality of its use.

However, it has also been acknowledged that designs of mobile phones currently offered in the market are not always user friendly where the under- privileged and less literate consumers are concerned

- digital divide as problem of access, but what about interface design? design also as site of inequality
- tech exacerbates inequalities
- affordable ICTs as solution to problem of access: technological solutionism

"It is optimistically assumed by some (à la Challoner, 2008 above) that ICT affordable to the masses would be an inevitable outcome of technological development, which in turn would solve the digital divide problem."
- digital divides vs digital inequalities: reframing of problem by some
- increasing importance of mobile in internet access
- access vs “affective use"
“socially embedded technology” approach
- mobile phones as “sociomaterial assemblage"

"This highlights the importance of moving beyond the physical access/adoption domain into a closer scrutiny of the actual access to benefits of the technology, by treating the mobile phone as a “sociomaterial assemblage” (Orlikowski, 2007, p. 1445); because, use of the phone in different ways is largely contextualised by the sociocultural situation of the user.” (714)

- cell phones designed for middle and upper classes may account for or contribute to “low use” by “underprivileged"
- “objectification” — making or realizing social norms and cultural constructions in/through objects, e.g. of cultural capital
     - objectification of digital divide in mobile phone
“design aspects of an artefact in user – technology relations, and the role they play in maintaining particular social orders"
- designers define/imagine actors and worlds in which products will be used: 
      "Such prescriptions incorporated into the designs allow people to perform certain activities with the artefacts while preventing other activities (Akrich & Latour, 1992)."
What might be examples of how designers imagine the worlds of their artifacts and users? What are examples of prescriptions for use of designed things?
- affordances as material aspects or features which support certain practices/uses:
     "[A]ffordances are aspects of a given technology’s materiality which only become relevant at the interface between that technology and some person’s attempt to put it to use for certain purposes"
     - affordances + knowledge/beliefs/skills determine object’s use, in situated, cultural context:
     - "affordances are historically and socioculturally situated phenomena (Bloomfield, Latham, & Vurdubakis, 2010)."
elite youth: mobile web, email, facebook, photos from phone to FB
non-elite: talk, text; less “computer-mediated communication” in sense of Internet-based; lack of english language proficiency as one barrier
- elite youth’s familiarity with computing and the Internet translates/migrates to phone practices
- perceived lack of access to information as a result; interfaces assume users are familiar with internet media already 
     "In other words, the users envisaged by designers are already users of these ICTs who simply seek to transfer those facilities from the computer to the mobile phone. Those who do not already possess the necessary skills are thus effectively prevented from accessing them. This could well be the reason why previous research has identified prior access to Internet through computers as a key factor that determines whether users would utilise sophisticated features of the phone (Zainudeen & Ratnadiwakara, 2011).” (is this circular?)
Why were fewer handsets, with more limited features, available in Sinhala? "What is also interesting is designers’ perception regarding intended users of Sinhala supported handsets. The assumption of designers appears to be that users who require Sinhala support would only be using the basic functions of the phone."
Reproduction of class system:
- "This means that the digital divide has been objectified in the designs of mobile phones, thereby contributing to its perpetuation instead of its reduction."
     - Is this inevitable? What would it take to change this inequality? 

Lilly Irani, Janet Vertesi, Paul Dourish, and Kavita Philip 2010 Postcolonial Computing: a Lens on Design and Development.

- HCI4D: HCI for development
     - Postcolonial computing: "Postcolonial computing is not a new domain or design space, but an alternative sensibility to the process of design and analysis"
- "the historical transformation of conditions of cultural encounter"
- what counts as good design in different places: "Postcolonial computing, then, is not a project of making better design for “other” cultures or places. It is a project of understanding how all design research and practice is culturally located and power laden, even if considered fairly general.”
     - implicit literacies and competences in design: "For example, design aesthetics vary wildly from place to place [21] and taken-for-granted symbolic literacies, such as recognizing an image representing a GUI button, are strange in less computer-saturated cultures [23]"
     - e.g. “user-centered design” in communitarian-oriented contexts: community-centered design (?)
     - co-design (participatory design?)
- hardware & infrastructure: designing for places with different tech infrastructures: "The notion of a hermetically sealed, all-in-one, “plug-and-play” design – seemingly perfectly adapted to an environment without an extensive technological infrastructure – turned out, in fact, to render it useless in the face of local contingencies.” —> fitness for purpose
     - modeling user’s “culture” as singular, as background competence/values vs. increasing globalization/transnationalism
- STS & postcolonial studies: "cultural entanglement and colonial discourses"
“taxonomic” (or nationalist…) view of “culture"
     - "Such language disconnected with the design brief, wherein culture was taxonomized, reified, and employed as a static denomination to distinguish between user groups and communities.” — culture seen as systematic differences between groups; usually geographical
     - spaces as bounded
     - limitations of cultural “averages” since people are not average
     - boundedness of space/geography called into question by communication and other technologies (though is this new?? or just the speed/scale/role of capital?)
     - at what scale is culture?
     - culture as a collective "system of interpretive signification through which the world inter-subjectively meaningful.” (culture as multiple, partial)
     - objects and activities become meaningful in practice, in context 
     - culture generated through action as well as shaping it: dynamic, collective, enacted rather than internal, acquired
     - necessary view to account for cultural CHANGE
How might technology design transform culture and cultural practices?
“technological solutionism"
- who defines development problems, and how are solutions developed and implemented? 
     - Ferguson on development: "p.4: development regimes in recent decades, he argues, have systematically avoided confronting the actions of large-scale actors such as governments and corporations as causes of the socioeconomic conditions they seek to remedy, instead seeking behavioral, educational, and market-based solutions at the local level.  -- Highlighted mar 17, 2016"
     - development/design: inattention to state and corporate actors, infrastructural and political problems
     - this leads to masking political causes of poverty; strips poverty of political dimension (“depoliticizing”)
     - depoliticizing poverty turns it into a technical problem requiring technical solutions; “development” as the means of this depoliticization and solutions
     - role of deregulation as well
     - role of interested parties (commercial/capitalist) often ignored in HCI4D
     - “postcolonialism” = flows of goods/capital/labor parallel colonial ones, esp extractive colonialism
     - development of new markets & consumers: developing countries as consumers of tech made elsewhere (1315)
- what counts as design, innovation, development, creativity, etc.? reverse engineering/hacking vs. piracy [capitalism and rise of novelty]
     - what’s value of novelty in design work? what principles guide design work?
"These cases suggest that the uneven flows and exchanges of capital that surround the uptake of information technologies have implications for HCI interests such as design method, software adoption, usefulness, usability."
- aligning infrastructures of knowledge and knowledge sharing in design and development
     - knowledge always situated, located, partial, specific, voiced, contextual, etc.
"The postcolonial computing lens focuses our attention, then, on the translations, dependencies, conditions, and histories that shape perceptions of technology and its opportunities."
- design methods/processes: engagement, articulation, translation
     - implicitly scientific (or scientistic) modes of testing and knowing and authority in design research/usability testing
     - participatory design: scandinavian context in which users are organized/unionized
- “shaping and staging encounters between multiple parties” (1317) (parallels to anthro & STS studies of experts/expertise)
     [incommensurability] — "Page 8 Cross-cultural design efforts, then, must recognize how articulation in UCD functions to frame and interpret engagement drawing on traditions of representation that may not be commensurable with knowledge and design practice in other cultures"
“ontological work” — giving something being, reality status
- knowledge as something performed, enacted, rather than a thing to be captured
- e.g. limitations of One Laptop Per Child program: "Page 8 Articulated design needs and requirements, in this case individual control and ownership, reflect a series of often unquestioned ontological, political, and economic commitments that are integral to the design."

- processes and methods of design seen as universal, even when products recognized as situated culturally (1319)
     - difficulties of circulating design practices and methods: "Page 9 Incommensurability might mark relations not only between different national cultures, but also organizational cultures, or even professional communities within an organization."
- valuing heterogeneity in design

Nikhil Anand 2011 Pressure: the PoliTechnics of Water Supply in Mumbai. Cultural Anthropology 26(4): 542–564.
denaturalize “fetishized relations of production and the hidden material networks and flows that urbanize nature”
- is corporality materiality? or a kind of materiality?
- water can exceed politics, because matter resists political control
“hydraulic citizenship” - a "form of belonging to the city enabled by social and material claims made to the city’s water infrastructure”
- citizenship constituted through water access, politically mediated
- political assistance required, often tacitly, to get a water connection for settlers
- key role of water in mediating political relationships and citizenship, i.e. between government and governed (551)
- water pressure, political pressure linked
- technocratic vs political terms: have a technical solution
- wealthy citizens receive public services the poor do not (554); also Hindus vs Muslims
     - us/them, clean/dirty, hardworking/lazy, easy/difficult, calm/noisy, moral/immoral
     - some bodies/inhabitants seen as from elsewhere (in nation) and therefore not citizens of the city: municipal vs national idea of citizenship articulated (555):
     
He saw them as being “from outside,” not only because they were Muslim but also because he identified them as “belonging” to other states (like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar). Kerkar articulated a municipal idea of citizenship distinct from that of the nation. In so doing, he excluded some national bodies from belonging to the largest city in the nation.
     - some not a “good public"
- illegal “infra political” acts not as resistance: "Page 16
Instead, I prefer to see them as politically mediated acts of unequal and inclusive settlement, both in the legal and in the material sense.” (556)
- wells: unregulated, not centralized, difficult for bureaucratic regimes to control
     - wells effectively separate some settlements from political infrastructure of city, as water exceeds political control
- pressure not as metaphor: "Page 17
 I suggest that by focusing on the ways in which settlers are able to mobilize pressure with the politics and materials of Mumbai’s water system, we can better understand the critical, compromised, and graduated ways in which settlers have been able to establish themselves in the city."
     - informal relationships that blur boundaries of legal/illegal, state/society
     - ability to pressure political system for access to water allows settlers to participate in municipal public
     - process is always ongoing, iterative, unstable because of demands on water system (and perhaps political system)
     - "Not interesting to municipal officials, well water produces other political authorities in the settlement"
- history of cities is history of water (560); materialities matter in diverse ways
